    "text": "Syntax\nSyntax is the grammatical rules of a programming language, and while R has a flexible syntax it does have rules.\nJust like on a calculator, it doesn’t make sense to ask what 3 */ 5 is. So what does R do? Try it!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR returns a ‘syntax error’ because it didn’t expect a division (/) to occur immediately after multiplication (*). While errors can be intimidating, they’re really trying to help. A syntax error in R starts with “unexpected” and then describes the part of your code which violates the syntax rules.\n\nSyntax errors are commonly from mismatched quotes ('...', \"...\") or brackets ((...), {...}), and can be tricky to fix. We’ll learn more about fixing errors in the next lesson about troubleshooting. \n\nCode comments\nOne way to make your code easier to understand is to add code comments. Any code after # will be completely ignored by R, allowing you to write helpful notes about what your code is doing. This is especially useful when sharing your code with others (or your future self)!\nAdd a code comment that explains what this code is doing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pipe, |&gt;\nA lot of functions in R (especially tidyverse functions) are designed to be chained together using |&gt; (the pipe). The pipe simply takes the result of the code on the left, and inserts it into the function on the right.\nExample:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting long chains of code with the pipe makes your code easier to read and can be documented with comments. The equivalent code without the pipe is mean(exp(rnorm(1000))), since rnorm(1000) is ‘piped’ into the exp() function giving exp(rnorm(1000)) which is then piped into the mean() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe magrittr pipe, %&gt;%\n\n\n\nYou might encounter a similar looking magrittr pipe (%&gt;%) in examples online. It is included in the magrittr package, and behaves very similarly to the native pipe.\nThe native pipe (|&gt;) was added to R in version 4.1.0 directly into R’s syntax, and is recommended for use with new code."

    "text": "Objects\nObjects are used to store data in R, which can be recalled later for use in other code.\nYou can create an object with the assignment operator &lt;-. You can also use =, but we recommend sticking to &lt;- since = is also used for named function inputs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf successful, it will look like nothing has happened because objects are created silently (no output messages). In RStudio, you will be able to see e added to your environment pane (top-right) with the value 2.7182818.\nThis object can be reused in other code, for example try computing the logarithm of e:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObject naming\nA clear and descriptive object name is an important for your code to be readable, maintainable, and less error-prone.\nThere are two main styles commonly used in R:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsnake_case (recommended)\n\n\n\nWords are separated by underscores (_).\nExample:\ntotal_sales &lt;- 1500\naverage_temperature &lt;- 23.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncamelCase\n\n\n\nThe first word is lowercase, and subsequent words start with a capital letter.\nExample:\ntotalSales &lt;- 1500\naverageTemperature &lt;- 23.5\n\n\n\n\n\nArtwork by @allison_horst.\nYou can use any object name you like (R doesn’t care), but we recommend that you:\n\nBe concise and descriptive\nNo-one likes to write out a really_long_object_name, however a clearly described variable is far better than x and y.\nSpell out all relevant details, for example temperature_celsius is better than temperature or temp (which can be confused for temporary).\nBe consistent\nChoose a naming convention (we recommend snake_case) and stick to it.\nAvoid existing names\nTry not to use names that are already used in R, especially not reserved words like TRUE and FALSE.\nCommon conflicting names include dt and df, which are the densities of t and F distributions (not abbreviations of data or data.frame).\nUse underscores only, no other special characters\nA lot of special characters (e.g. $, @, !, ., #) have special meanings in R, and should not be used.\nFun fact: Until R v2.0.0 (October 2004), underscore was the assignment operator!\n\n\n\nData types\nEach object in R has a type, here are some commonly used data types:\n\nNumeric: 42, 3.14\nWith sub-types:\n\nInteger: 42L (without decimals, the L indicates integer)\nDouble: 3.14 (with decimals)\n\nCharacter: \"startr\"\nLogical: TRUE and FALSE\nDate and Time: Sys.Date() and Sys.time()\n\nR also supports some special data types commonly used in statistics and data analysis:\n\nMissing values: NA\nEach data type can contain NA (not available) to indicate unknown values.\nComplex: 1 + 2i\nComplex numbers consist of real and imaginary parts.\n\nYou can check the data type of a variable with the class() function, and check if an object is a particular type with is.*() (for example is.numeric() and is.logical()).\n\n\nMixing data types\nR automatically converts between data types for you as needed, generally this is helpful and works well but it can sometimes be surprising.\nExperiment with combining different types of data mathematically, and try to reason why you get each result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany of these mixed data type operations convert one type into another, in the above example:\n\n1L + 3.5: the integer (1L) became a double (1.0)\nTRUE + 3: the logical (TRUE) became numeric/double (1.0)\n\nYou can explicitly convert an object into a different type using as.*() functions (for example as.numeric() and as.character())."

Vectors are used extensively in R since datasets typically contain more than one observation! A singular value (usually a ‘scalar’ in other languages) is handled as a length 1 vector, so all of the previous examples have used R vectors.\nThe c() function (the combine function) is used to combine multiple vectors together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also generate sequences with seq(), or simply with from:to for integer sequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome other useful vector functions include:\nMathematical Summaries:\n\nsum(): Calculate the total of all elements.\n\nmean(): Compute the average value.\nany(): Check if any element is TRUE.\n\nall(): Check if all elements are TRUE.\n\nmin(): Find the minimum value.\n\nmax(): Find the maximum value.\n\nmedian(): Compute the middle value.\n\nquantile(): Compute specified quantiles.\n\nsd(): Calculate the standard deviation.\n\nvar(): Compute the variance.\n\nprod(): Calculate the product of all elements.\n\nCumulative maths:\n\ncumsum(): Compute the cumulative sum of elements.\n\ncumprod(): Compute the cumulative product of elements.\n\ndiff(): Calculate the differences between consecutive elements.\n\nVector Manipulation :\n\nrep(): Replicate elements in the vector.\nsort(): Sort elements in ascending or descending order.\n\nrev(): Reverse the order of elements.\n\nlength(): Get the number of elements in the vector.\ntable(): Create a frequency table of elements.\n\nSet Operations:\n\nunion(): Combine elements from two vectors, removing duplicates.\n\nintersect(): Find common elements between two vectors.\n\nsetdiff(): Find elements in one vector that are not in another.\n\nsetequal(): Check if two vectors contain the same elements (ignoring order).\n\nduplicated(): Identify duplicate elements in a vector.\n\nunique(): Extract unique elements from a vector.\n\n\nTry some of these functions out on these vectors:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens when you try math operations such as + and * between random_integers and random_numbers?\n\n\nMatrices\nA matrix is a 2-dimensional data structure where all elements must be of the same type (e.g., numeric, character). A matrix is constructed with the matrix() function:\n\nmatrix(data, nrow, ncol, byrow = FALSE)\n\ndata: A vector to fill the matrix.\n\nnrow: Number of rows.\nncol: Number of columns.\nbyrow: Whether data fills the matrix row-wise (TRUE) or column-wise (FALSE).\n\n\nTry to create a matrix with 26 rows and 2 columns, containing all lower case letters in the first column and upper case LETTERS in the second column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome useful functions for working with matrices includes:\n\ndim(): Get the dimensions (rows and columns) of the matrix.\n\nnrow(), ncol(): Get the number of rows or columns, respectively.\n\ncbind(), rbind(): Combine vectors/matrices together by columns or rows.\nrowSums(), colSums(): Compute the sum of each row or column.\n\nrowMeans(), colMeans(): Compute the mean of each row or column.\n\nt(): Transpose the matrix (swap rows and columns).\n\ndiag(): Extract or set the diagonal of a matrix.\n\nx %*% y: Perform matrix multiplication of x and y.\n\n\n\nArrays\nArrays are similar to matrices, but extend to higher dimensional structures. They are created with the array() function:\n\narray(data, dim)\n\ndata: A vector to fill the matrix.\n\ndim: A vector of dimension sizes.\n\n\n\n\nIndexing and Slicing\nThe index of a vector (or matrix/array) is the position of each element. Indexing refers to the extraction of a specific value from a vector using its index (position). Relatedly, slicing extracts 0 or more values from the vector.\nMathematically, this is equivalent to \\(x_i\\) where \\(x\\) is your vector and \\(i\\) are the index position(s) to extract. Indexing and slicing starts from 1 in R (other languages start from 0), so the first value is at index 1 and the last value is at index length(x).\nTo index/slice a vector, we use single square brackets: x[i], where x is your vector and i is a vector of positions to extract.\nTry to find the 13th letter of the alphabet by indexing the letters object:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow try to slice the first 10 letters by constructing a numeric sequence with seq():\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sequence of integers from 1 to 10 can be created with this code\nseq(1, 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther indices\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use logical values as your index, which will keep values if the index is TRUE.\nNegative indices can also be used, which will remove those positions from the vector.\n\n\n\nYou can also index/slice matrices and arrays, you simply need to specify more dimensions inside the square brackets. For a matrix it is x[rows, cols], and for an array you would use x[i, j, k, ...] for each dimension.\nThe volcano matrix details the topography of Auckland’s Maunga Whau volcano, extract the first 10 rows and columns 43 to 51.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlicing only one dimension\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen slicing only one dimension (e.g. only rows keeping all columns), you can omit the unused dimension from the square brackets. For example, volcano[1:10,] will keep the first 10 rows and all columns of the volcano matrix. Similarly, volcano[,43:51] will keep all rows and slice columns 43 to 51 from the matrix.\nIf you slice only one column or row (e.g. volcano[1,] for the first row only), R will simplify the result into a vector. This can be problematic if you’re doing matrix multiplication, so it can be useful to use volcano[1,,drop = FALSE] to prevent dropping the matrix class."

For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that lists can contain anything, and of any length. The date in the example above has a different length and data type from the letters.\n\n\nData frames\nA data.frame is very similar to a list, but it requires all vectors (of possibly different types) to have the same length (the number of rows in the data). Data frames can be constructed with the data.frame() function, where each column or the dataset is a vector used in this function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can see that the data.frame has 26 rows and that today’s date has been replicated to fit the dataset.\nA data frame is one of the most commonly used data structures in R for storing data. It is similar to a matrix, but it allows you to store different types of data (numeric, character, logical, etc.) in different columns.\nData frames are usually created by importing data files, the most common data format is CSV (comma separated values) which can be read in with read.csv(). More information about reading data can be found in the data reading lesson. \nMany packages also come with datasets for demonstrating examples, we’ll be using the penguins data.frame from the palmerpenguins package:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndexing, slicing, and extracting\nLists and data frames can also be indexed and sliced using single square brackets (x[i]). Lists are 1D (like vectors), and data frames are 2D (like matrices).\nIt is also possible to extract a column/vector out of lists and data frames. This is accomplished using double square brackets (x[[3]], or x[[\"column\"]]) or the dollar sign for named columns (x$column)."

This newly created object should appear in the environment tab.\nThis pane also includes other tabs containing tools specific to your R project (such as document rendering and version control with git). R projects are explained more in a later lesson. \nFiles, Packages, Help and Outputs Pane (Bottom-Right) This is where most of your visual outputs are shown.\nThis pane contains tabs for many output types:\n\nPlots: View generated plots.\nViewer: View interactive outputs and documents.\nPresentation: View presentation slides.\n\nIt also includes useful tools for writing R code, including:\n\nFiles: Explore your files.\nHelp: View and search documentation for R functions.\nPackages: Manage installed packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomising your workspace\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appearance and layout of your workspace is fully customisable.

    "text": "R Projects\nR Projects are an RStudio feature that can help you organise all files related to a single project folder and access them in a project specific workspace.\n\n\n\nArtwork by @allison_horst.\nUsing an R Project in RStudio helps with:\n\nAutomatic working directory: When you open an R Project, RStudio automatically sets the working directory location to the project’s folder. The working directory is the folder relative file paths are built from (more details later).\nProject settings: The .Rproj file created when you make an R Project stores project-specific settings and keyboard shortcuts (e.g., git, packages, or documents). These settings are automatically loaded when you open the project in RStudio.\nWorkspace restoration: When you reopen an R Project, Rstudio will reload your workspace (scripts, unsaved changes and history) exactly how you left it.\nFolder structure: R projects make it easy to access related files in the project folder with relative paths, making your analysis easier to share with others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate an R project\n\nClick the project drop-down in the top-right corner. Then click on the “New Project…”.\n\n\n\nIt will show you three options.\n\nNew Directory: Start from scratch with a new empty folder for your project.\nExisting Directory: If you’re already started some work without a project, convert that folder into a project.\nVersion Control: If your work already exists elsewhere as a git or svn repository (such as GitHub), this will download the work and create a project for it.\n\nFor your very first R project, let’s start by selecting “New Directory”.\n\n\n\nThere are many different types of R projects that you can create. These various project types come bundled with starter code and settings (for shortcuts and build options). A standard project (without any boilerplate or settings) is suitable most projects - so simply select “New Project” for an empty folder.\n\n\n\nGive your project (and the folder containing it) a name using the “Directory name:” field. You can also choose where the project will exist on your computer by clicking on the “Browse…” button. If you do not choose, it will be in your home folder (/home/&lt;username&gt; on macOS, and C:/Users/&lt;username&gt; on Windows). You can leave the rest (git and renv) unchecked for now.\n\n\n\nClick “Create Project”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject created!\n\n\n\nYou have now successfully created the R project! Verify this by checking:\n\nThe project name in the top right project dropdown\nThe current working directory (getwd()) is the project folder\nThe files pane shows the content of your project folder\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing R projects\nThere are multiple ways to open an R Project in RStudio:\n\nRStudio Project Selector:\nUse the project selector dropdown in the top right corner to quicky switch between recent projects. \nOpening the .Rproj File:\nOpen the project’s .Rproj file from your file explorer. \n\nAny work you do while in this project will be restored when you next open the project (even unsaved files, but please don’t rely on this and save your work!).\nYou can close the project by simply closing RStudio (or via Project selector (top-right) → Close Project to keep RStudio open).\nWhen you close your project you might be prompted to save your ‘workspace image’, to which we recommend you select Don’t Save.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving the workspace image? No!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile you should always save your work, it is best for reproducibility to not save your workspace image. Saving the workspace means next time you open the project, R Studio will also reload your last R session, along all of the variables and functions you previously created. While this seems convenient, it is better to explicitly load data and scripts each time you open a project to ensure that your analysis results can be re-run by anyone, including your future self.\n\n\nYou can prevent the popup messages by going to Tools → Global Options. Then select General on the side-bar and change “Save workspace to .RData on exit” to “Never”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject organisation\n\n\n\nArtwork by @allison_horst.\nWhile an R Project helps you quickly switch between projects, it is up to you to organise your files into suitable subfolders within the project folder. By structuring your files effectively, you can reduce the risk of losing important data, simplify the code for accessing your data, and make it easier to locate each script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile folders\nA clear and consistent folder structure starts with sensible folder names. Here’s an example of a typical R Project directory structure:\nmy-awesome-project/\n├── data-raw/                   # Raw / unprocessed data files\n│   ├── survey_results_2024.csv\n│   ├── population_data.xlsx\n├── data/                       # Clean / processed data files\n│   ├── survey_cleaned_2024.csv\n│   ├── population_summary.csv\n├── R/                          # R scripts\n│   ├── data_cleaning.R\n│   ├── exploratory_analysis.R\n│   └── model_fitting.R\n├── outputs/                    # Results, figures, tables, and other outputs\n│   ├── figures/                # Graphs and charts\n│   │   ├── age_distribution_plot.png\n│   │   └── time_series_trends.jpeg\n│   └── tables/                 # Data tables and results\n│       ├── regression_summary.csv\n├── README.md                   # Project description and instructions\n└── my-awesome-project.Rproj    # R Project file\nThis structure is suitable for most simple data analysis projects. We recommend you try to organise a few projects with this template before making modifications based on your personal preferences and project specific needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand For Recommended Folder Uses\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndata-raw/: This folder holds all original data files related to the project. Keeping raw and processed data separate ensures transparency and helps maintain data integrity.\ndata/: Save your tidy, clean and otherwise processed data here. This allows you to quickly read in analysis-ready data without needing to re-run your data cleaning script.\nR/: Store all your R scripts here, we recommend the folder name “R” (to match the structure of an R package). More language-agnostic projects might use a “src”, “scripts”, or “code” folder. It’s a good practice to separate scripts into different categories depending on their function (e.g., data cleaning, analysis, modelling).\noutputs/: This folder stores the outputs of your analysis, such as figures, tables, or models. You can have subfolders like figures/ and tables/ to separate the different types of results. This makes it easier to find specific outputs and ensures that your working directory isn’t cluttered with unnecessary files.\nREADME.md: A README file is essential for documenting the purpose of the project, how to run the analysis, and any specific instructions for collaborators. This file helps others (and yourself, in the future) understand the project structure, dependencies, and key steps involved.\nmy-awesome-project.Rproj: This is the R Project file, which we created earlier. Projects help maintain your project’s workspace, settings, and set the working directory. It should always be kept at the root of the project folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPortable and reproducible projects\nOne of the key principles of maintaining an organised and reproducible workflow is to keep all project-related files within the project folder. This approach ensures that your project has:\n\nReproducibility: By keeping everything in one place, you ensure that your code can easily locate all the necessary files (data, scripts, outputs) using relative paths. This makes your analysis reproducible for anyone who accesses the project.\nPortability: A self-contained project is portable, meaning you can move it to another computer, share it with collaborators, or distribute it with version control platforms (e.g. GitHub) without breaking any links or dependencies.\nOrganisation: Storing all files in one structured location helps avoid confusion and ensures you can quickly locate the resources you need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR packages not included\n\n\n\n\n\nR projects usually include everything except the R packages it depends on, which are instead usually found in the system’s global R environment.\nThis can cause reproducibility issues if the project is used on a system where some packages are missing, incompatible, or at different versions with different functionality. To address this, you can use the renv package, which bundles and manages package versions locally within the project folder. This ensures that your analysis always uses the correct versions of dependencies. \n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your understanding\nWhat is the main benefit of using an RStudio Project?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can you open an RStudio Project?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens to the working directory when you open an RStudio Project?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the following files is typically included in an RStudio Project?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the following is NOT true about RStudio Projects?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should you avoid when closing an RStudio Project?"

    "section": "File Paths",
    "text": "File Paths\nWhen working with files in R, understanding and using file paths correctly is essential to ensure your scripts run seamlessly, whether on your computer or someone else’s.\n\n\nFile paths can be specified in two main ways: absolute paths and relative paths. Both approaches work to locate files, but they behave very differently when running your code on other computers. Appropriately specified file paths ensure that your projects will be portable to other people’s computers by enabling others to execute your analysis workflow without editing your scripts.\n\nAbsolute paths\nAn absolute path specifies the full location of a file or folder on your system starting from the root directory (e.g., C:/ on Windows or / on macOS/Linux).\nExample:\n# Windows\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"C:/Users/Admin/Documents/my-awesome-project/data/survey_data.csv\")\n\n# macOS/Linux\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"/home/Admin/Documents/my-awesome-project/data/survey_data.csv\")\nNotice how the file path differs between operating systems? This is bad for reproducibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute paths are NOT portable!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile absolute paths work on your computer, they are not portable because:\n\nThey depend on the exact file structure of your system.\nIf you share your project with others, their computer systems may not have the same directory structure.\nMoving your project to a new location can break the paths.\n\nFor these reasons, using absolute paths is strongly discouraged.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative paths\nA relative path specifies the location of a file or folder relative to the current working directory. If you work within an [R Project]((#sec-projects), the current working directory is automatically set to the project folder, making relative paths the most reliable and portable option.\nExample:\n# Windows/macOS/Linux\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"./data/survey_data.csv\")\nIn this example:\n\n./ refers to the current working directory. It is optional.\n./data/ navigates to the data/ subfolder within the project folder.\n\nRelative paths ensure that your scripts work regardless of where the project folder is located, as long as the folder structure remains consistent. This makes them ideal for reproducible analysis. 🎉\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding files\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen specifying file paths in R, you can use tab completion to quickly find and insert file paths. Inside quotation marks (““), start typing the folder or file name and press the TabTab key.\nRStudio will then show a list of matching files and folders, making it easier to navigate your project, find files and avoid typos.\nVideo\n\n\n\n\nWorking directories\nThe working directory in an R session is the folder from which R looks for files specified using relative paths. The working directory is almost always your project folder.\nYou can check your current working directory with the getwd() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function returns the absolute path of the current working directory.\nYou can (but shouldn’t) change your working directory with setwd(). Instead, we strongly recommend using R Projects and relative paths from the project folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking directory in R Markdown and Quarto\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen running R Markdown or Quarto documents, the working directory is instead the location of the document. You can think of these documents as being their own mini-projects, where files paths to images and data are relative to the document.\nIf your document is in a sub-folder of an R project the relative paths can be confusing. R scripts will use the project folder, while your R documents will use the document folder!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject paths\nAnother type of relative path is a project path, which specifies the location of files relative to the project folder (rather than the working directory). This can be useful since the project paths will work even if the working directory in R changes (e.g. when using code in R Markdown or Quarto documents).\n\n\n\nArtwork by @allison_horst.\nThe here package helps you create file paths relative to the project folder, ensuring that your scripts and analyses are portable and reproducible across different systems. The here() function automatically detects the project folder based on the location of your .Rproj file (or other indicators, like a README.md or .git folder).\nExample:\n# Windows/macOS/Linux\ndata &lt;- read.csv(here::here(\"data/survey_data.csv\"))\nIn this example:\n\nhere::here() refers to the the project folder.\ndata/survey_data.csv is the path to the dataset from the project folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject portability\n\n\n\n\n\nSince project paths are relative to the project folder, you will need to share the entire project for your code to be reproducible by others. Without the .Rproj file (or other project indicator), the here::here() package won’t know which folder is your project folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal paths\nExternal paths refer to file locations external to the computer you are using but accessible over a network connection. External paths are specified with a URL (Uniform Resource Locator).\nExample:\n# Windows/macOS/Linux\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"https://learnr.numbat.space/data/survey_results.csv\")\nA URL consists of several parts:\n\nProtocol (https://): The communication method used to access the resource. Most often this will be http or https (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, the protocol for websites). Other protocols that are commonly used include ftp (File Transfer Protocol), or s3 (Simply Storage Service).\nAddress / Location (learnr.numbat.space): The network address of the server hosting the resource. In this case, learnr.numbat.space is the address, identifying the specific server to connect to.\n\nPath (/data/survey_results.csv): The absolute path of the file or resource on the server.\nOther Information: Sometimes additional details are needed to connect to the external server, commonly this is:\n\nA port number like :8080 specifies a network port (https://learnr.numbat.space:8080/...).\n\nCredentials like username:password@ can provide login information (https://user:pass@learnr.numbat.space/...).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing external paths\n\n\n\n\n\nMany R functions allow you to directly use web URLs for accessing data, for example read.csv() shown earlier. If the function you want doesn’t support external file paths, you can download the files with download.file().\ndownload.file(\"https://learnr.numbat.space/data/survey_results.csv\", destfile = \"data/survey_results.csv\")\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"data/survey_results.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your understanding\nWhich of the following is an example of an absolute path?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should you avoid using absolute paths in R scripts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the {here} package do?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the following is NOT true about relative paths?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich part of the URL specifies the communication method for the external resource?"

Before asking a question on Stack Overflow, you can search some key words from your understanding of error messages. It is likely that people have already asked similar questions related to your error and you can try the solutions provided by others under the question.\n\n\nRStudio Community.\nThis is a community channel for RStudio users. Similar to Stack Overflow, you can ask questions and also find solutions.\n\n\nGitHub.\nIf you’ve thoroughly investigated your error and believe the issue lies in the package rather than your code, you can contact the package’s developer. Most R packages are open-source and maintained on Github.\n1. Search for the package’s repository using its name along with “R” and “GitHub”.\n2. Use the “Issues” tab to report your problem.\n3. Make sure to check if the issue has already been reported before creating a new one.\n\n\nDiscussion Forum on Moodle or Ed.\nIf you’re preparing for your Monash University course, a good place to ask for help is the discussion forum on Moodle. You can also seek assistance from your lecturers and tutors.\n\nIf your unit uses Ed as a discussion space, use it to ask or answer questions. Some units may even allow you to post privately or anonymously if you feel shy posting publicly.\n\n\n\nTrusty (sometimes) AI.\nThere are many AI tools that can help you write code, and some can even help you debug it. However, AI should be used with caution. While it can assist in troubleshooting errors, it may not always provide the best solution. You should still try to understand what the code is doing and why it’s causing an error to avoid using code from AI which may be producing inaccurate results (despite running without error).\n\n\nTeachers and Tutors in Consultations.\nAsk your lecturers and tutors for help during consultation sessions, which are available for any content-related difficulties, including debugging code.\n\nPrepare a small demonstration of your error beforehand to make the session more effective.\nThe benefit of these sessions is that we can guide you closer to the solution until you figure it out yourself.\nDon’t be disheartened if your error, which you’ve struggled with for hours, is solved in minutes — we’ve had plenty of practice (also being stuck for hours) troubleshooting these errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp and Learn\n\n\n\nAnswering questions on the forum can help consolidate your understanding and prepare you for asking and answering questions in other forums such as Stack Overflow."

    "text": "Providing minimal datasets\nIf your question involves using a dataset, you will need to provide a small dataset to demonstrate the problem. Often people say that the data is confidential and can’t be provided, but usually the problem isn’t specific to the data you are using. Taking the time to try your code on a different dataset is a good debugging step, and R provides many good datasets to use in these examples built in. You can find a complete list of datasets available to all R users with the data(package = \"datasets\") function.\nIf you do need to use a custom dataset specific to your project, try reducing the size of the dataset before making your example. The error may only occur for some specific rows of your data. Once you’ve narrowed in on the issue, you can convert your minimal data object to code for producing it using the dput() function.\nFor example you can use use the below code to provide the first 6 rows of the iris dataset.\n\ndput(head(iris))\n\nstructure(list(Sepal.Length = c(5.1, 4.9, 4.7, 4.6, 5, 5.4), \n    Sepal.Width = c(3.5, 3, 3.2, 3.1, 3.6, 3.9), Petal.Length = c(1.4, \n    1.4, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, 1.7), Petal.Width = c(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, \n    0.2, 0.2, 0.4), Species = structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, 1L, \n    1L), levels = c(\"setosa\", \"versicolor\", \"virginica\"), class = \"factor\")), row.names = c(NA, \n6L), class = \"data.frame\")\n\n\nTry it yourself!

Not everyone has the same file structure as you, so they won’t be able to access your dataset if it is stored at /home/learnr/Documents/My Job/project_2040/data/housing_prices.csv. Instead provide a short relative oath, such as housing_prices.csv or data/housing_prices.csv. If you’re uploading files, it’s also nice to provide a zip that contains a R script of your minimal reproducible code, along with the data in the folders referenced by the script.\n– potentially a multiple choice question here on relative paths? —"

When you run into an error, providing your entire analysis just makes it more time consuming for helpers to run your code and identify the source of the error.\nA minimal reproducible example cuts out as much of the code as possible, keeping just a few essential lines for producing the error. If your error comes after the data cleaning, remove that code and start with a clean, minimal dataset.\nIf your code includes any randomisation, it’s a good idea to set the random seed using the set.seed() function. This ensures that each time the code is ran, the same random results are obtained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducing random results\n\n\n\nThe set.seed() function in R ensures reproducible results in code involving random values. It guarantees the same random values are produced each time you run the code, aiding in debugging and consistency. The number in the brackets can be any integer.\n\n\nThe process of cleaning up your code and reducing it down into a small example is another great exercise that often helps you identify the problem and fix it yourself.\nRemember, you need to provide all code necessary to load in packages you use, read in data and run functions that cause the error."
