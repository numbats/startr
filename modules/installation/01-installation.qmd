# Background

## Why do we want to learn and use R and RStudio

R and Rstudio are powerful tools for statistical analysis. R is an open-source language, meaning it is both free and supported by a large, active community. RStudio provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making using R more productive. The R package (more on this later) ecosystem allows users to extend its functionality for various types of analysis. Additionally, it facilitates reproducible code and reports and allows researchers to share their work with others.


## What is R and RStudio

R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. To understand why we might want to use R with RStudio. We will use the analogy from [Modern Dive book](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html#r-rstudio). 

>  At its simplest, R is like a car’s engine while RStudio is like a car’s dashboard
