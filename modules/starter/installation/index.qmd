<!-- ## Why do we want to learn and use R and RStudio -->

<!-- R and RStudio are powerful tools for statistical analysis. R is an open-source language, meaning it is both free and supported by a large, active community. RStudio provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making using R more productive. The R package (more on this later) ecosystem allows users to extend its functionality for various types of analysis. Additionally, it facilitates reproducible code and reports and allows researchers to share their work with others. -->

# R and RStudio

R is a free and open-source programming language designed for statistical computing, data analysis, and graphics. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, designed to make coding and data analysis more efficient and user-friendly.

To understand the benefits of using R with RStudio, let's draw on an analogy from the [Modern Dive book](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html#r-rstudio). 

>  At its simplest, R is like a car's engine while RStudio is like a car's dashboard.

![](resources/R_vs_RStudio.png)

The engine (R) is what runs all of your analysis, while the dashboard (RStudio) provides an interface to efficiently control and navigate it.

Rtools includes compilers and other utilities which help install packages from sources which contain C, C++, or Fortran code.

**Download Rtools**:

1. Open your browser and go to the Rtools page: [Rtools for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
2. Find the version of Rtools that matches your version of R (e.g., Rtools43 is compatible with R 4.3.x).

## Installing Xcode (optional)

On macOS, you may need to install **Xcode Command Line Tools** to compile R packages that require compiled code (such as C, C++, or Fortran). If you are creating R packages, or installing R packages from sources it is useful to have Xcode installed.

Rtools includes compilers and other utilities which help install packages from sources which contain C, C++, or Fortran code.


**Install Xcode Command Line Tools**:

1. Open the **Terminal** application (you can find it via Spotlight search).
2. Run the following command to install Xcode Command Line Tools:

   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

3. A pop-up will appear prompting you to install the tools. Click **Install** to proceed.

### Linux {.instructions .linux .collapse}

Below are instructions for installing R on Ubuntu / Debian systems. For other linux distributions, please refer to these R installation instructions: <https://docs.posit.co/resources/install-r.html>

1. Open a new **Terminal** window.

2. Run the following command to ensure your package list is up-to-date:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

3. Install the necessary software properties package:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
   ```

4. Add the CRAN repository to your list of package sources:
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -c | awk '{print $2}')/"

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y r-base
   ```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
