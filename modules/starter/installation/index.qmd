<!-- # Background -->

<!-- ## Why do we want to learn and use R and RStudio -->

<!-- R and RStudio are powerful tools for statistical analysis. R is an open-source language, meaning it is both free and supported by a large, active community. RStudio provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making using R more productive. The R package (more on this later) ecosystem allows users to extend its functionality for various types of analysis. Additionally, it facilitates reproducible code and reports and allows researchers to share their work with others. -->

# R and RStudio

R is a free and open-source programming language designed for statistical computing, data analysis, and graphics. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, designed to make coding and data analysis more efficient and user-friendly.

To understand the benefits of using R with RStudio, let's draw on an analogy from the [Modern Dive book](https://moderndive.com/1-getting-started.html#r-rstudio). 

>  At its simplest, R is like a car's engine while RStudio is like a car's dashboard.

![](resources/R_vs_RStudio.png)

The engine (R) is what runs all of your analysis, while the dashboard (RStudio) provides an interface to efficiently control and navigate it.

# Installation

Select your operating system for detailed instructions on installing R and RStudio.

```{js}
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
  // Add event listeners to columns with data-bs-target
   document.querySelectorAll('.g-col-4').forEach(function(item) {
    item.addEventListener('click', function() {
      // Get the target collapse section
      const targetClass = item.getAttribute('data-show-target');
      console.log(targetClass);

      // Collapse all other sections with .collapse class
      document.querySelectorAll('.collapse.instructions').forEach(function(collapse) {
        if (collapse.classList.contains(targetClass)) {
          new bootstrap.Collapse(collapse, { toggle: true })
        } else {
          new bootstrap.Collapse(collapse, { toggle: false }).hide();
        }
      });
    });
  });
});
```

### Windows {.instructions .windows .collapse}

**Download the R installer**:

1. Open your web browser and go to the [R Project website](https://cran.r-project.org).

2. Under the "Download and Install R" section, click on the "Download R for Windows" link.

![](resources/R_install_windows_1.png)

3. On the next page, click on "base" to download the base distribution of R.

![](resources/R_install_windows_2.png)

4. Click on the "Download R x.x.x for Windows" link (the version number will vary).

![](resources/R_install_windows_3.png)

5. Save the `.exe` file to your computer (the download should begin automatically).

**Install R**:

1. Once the `.exe` file has been downloaded, open the executable file.

![](resources/R_install_windows_4.png)

2. Allow the installer to change your device.

![](resources/R_install_windows_5.png)

3. The R Setup Wizard will appear. Click **Next**.
4. Accept the license agreement by selecting **I Agree**.
5. Choose the installation path. The default is usually fine (e.g., `C:\Program Files\R\R-x.x.x`), but you can choose a different directory if you prefer. Click **Next**.
6. Select components for installation. The default components (which include everything you need) should be fine, so click **Next**.
7. Choose the start menu folder for the R shortcut, or leave it as the default and click **Next**.
8. Select whether you want to associate R with `.R`, `.Rdata`, and `.rds` files. You can accept the default option and click **Next**.
9. Choose whether to create a desktop shortcut for R. If you want it, leave the box checked and click **Next**.
10. Click **Install** to begin the installation.
11. Once the installation is complete, click **Finish** to exit the setup wizard.

## Installing Rtools (optional)

**Rtools** is a collection of software tools necessary for building R packages on Windows. If you are creating R packages, or installing R packages from sources it is useful to have Rtools installed.

Rtools includes compilers and other utilities which help install packages from sources which contain C, C++, or Fortran code.

**Download Rtools**:

1. Open your browser and go to the Rtools page: [Rtools for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
2. Find the version of Rtools that matches your version of R (e.g., Rtools43 is compatible with R 4.3.x).
3. Click on the download link for the appropriate Rtools version (e.g., `Rtools43.exe` for R 4.3.x).

**Install Rtools**:

1. After downloading the installer, double-click on the `.exe` file to start the installation process.
2. In the Setup Wizard, select **Next**.
3. Accept the license agreement and click **Next**.
4. Choose the installation path (the default should be fine), then click **Next**.
5. Select the components to install. The default components should suffice for most users, so click **Next**.
6. Choose whether to add Rtools to your system’s PATH variable. It is highly recommended to leave this option checked, as it will make Rtools available from the command line. Click **Next**.
7. Click **Install** to begin the installation process.
8. Once installation is complete, click **Finish**.

## Installing Xcode (optional)

On macOS, you may need to install **Xcode Command Line Tools** to compile R packages that require compiled code (such as C, C++, or Fortran). If you are creating R packages, or installing R packages from sources it is useful to have Xcode installed.

Rtools includes compilers and other utilities which help install packages from sources which contain C, C++, or Fortran code.


**Install Xcode Command Line Tools**:

1. Open the **Terminal** application (you can find it via Spotlight search).
2. Run the following command to install Xcode Command Line Tools:

   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

3. A pop-up will appear prompting you to install the tools. Click **Install** to proceed.

### Linux {.instructions .linux .collapse}

Below are instructions for installing R on Ubuntu / Debian systems. For other linux distributions, please refer to these R installation instructions: <https://docs.posit.co/resources/install-r.html>

1. Open a new **Terminal** window.

2. Run the following command to ensure your package list is up-to-date:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

3. Install the necessary software properties package:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
   ```

4. Add the CRAN repository to your list of package sources:
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -c | awk '{print $2}')/"

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
   
2. Install R:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y r-base
   ```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Installing r-base-dev (optional)

The `r-base-dev` package contains development tools and libraries needed to compile R packages from source. It is particularly important when you want to install R packages that require compiling native code (such as C, C++, or Fortran). 

To install `r-base-dev` (after installing `r-base`):

1. Open a **Terminal** window.
2. Run the following command to install `r-base-dev`:
